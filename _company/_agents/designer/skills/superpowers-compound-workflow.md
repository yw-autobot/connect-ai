# Superpowers + Compound Engineering Workflow

Source repositories:
- https://github.com/obra/superpowers.git
- https://github.com/EveryInc/compound-engineering-plugin.git

## When the user assigns work
- Before coding/execution, check whether the task needs brainstorming, planning, debugging, TDD, code review, verification, or compounding.
- Use Superpowers flow as the operating method: clarify -> plan -> execute in small steps -> verify -> request/receive review -> finish safely.
- Use Compound Engineering after a review, fix, bug investigation, or repeated mistake: capture the lesson, root cause, fix, verification, and prevention rule so the next task is easier.
- Do not claim completion without fresh verification evidence. Do not perform risky deploy/send/delete/payment actions without approval gates.

## Assigned skills for this agent
- $(System.Collections.Specialized.OrderedDictionary.name): "You MUST use this before any creative work - creating features, building components, adding functionality, or modifying behavior. Explores user intent, requirements and design before implementation." [_company/_shared/vendor/obra-superpowers/skills/brainstorming/SKILL.md]
- $(System.Collections.Specialized.OrderedDictionary.name): Use when starting any conversation - establishes how to find and use skills, requiring Skill tool invocation before ANY response including clarifying questions [_company/_shared/vendor/obra-superpowers/skills/using-superpowers/SKILL.md]
- $(System.Collections.Specialized.OrderedDictionary.name): 'Build web interfaces with genuine design quality, not AI slop. Use for any frontend work - landing pages, web apps, dashboards, admin panels, components, interactive experiences. Activates for both greenfield builds and modifications to existing applications. Detects existing design systems and respects them. Covers composition, typography, color, motion, and copy. Verifies results via screenshots before declaring done.' [_company/_shared/vendor/compound-engineering-plugin/plugins/compound-engineering/skills/ce-frontend-design/SKILL.md]
- $(System.Collections.Specialized.OrderedDictionary.name): "Capture a visual demo reel (GIF, terminal recording, screenshots) for PR descriptions. Use when shipping UI changes, CLI features, or any work with observable behavior that benefits from visual proof. Also use when asked to add a demo, record a GIF, screenshot a feature, show what changed visually, create a demo reel, capture evidence, add proof to a PR, or create a before/after comparison." [_company/_shared/vendor/compound-engineering-plugin/plugins/compound-engineering/skills/ce-demo-reel/SKILL.md]
- $(System.Collections.Specialized.OrderedDictionary.name): "[BETA] Start the dev server, open the feature in a browser, and iterate on improvements together." [_company/_shared/vendor/compound-engineering-plugin/plugins/compound-engineering/skills/ce-polish-beta/SKILL.md]
- $(System.Collections.Specialized.OrderedDictionary.name): Document a recently solved problem to compound your team's knowledge [_company/_shared/vendor/compound-engineering-plugin/plugins/compound-engineering/skills/ce-compound/SKILL.md]

## Required closeout habit
- At the end of any implementation/review cycle, ask: what mistake, surprise, repeated friction, or useful pattern should be compounded?
- If there is a reusable lesson, write/update a concise learning note under `_company/_shared/compound_lessons/` or mention it in the final report for CEO/Secretary to store.
