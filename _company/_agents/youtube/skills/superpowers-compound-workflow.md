# Superpowers + Compound Engineering Workflow

Source repositories:
- https://github.com/obra/superpowers.git
- https://github.com/EveryInc/compound-engineering-plugin.git

## When the user assigns work
- Before coding/execution, check whether the task needs brainstorming, planning, debugging, TDD, code review, verification, or compounding.
- Use Superpowers flow as the operating method: clarify -> plan -> execute in small steps -> verify -> request/receive review -> finish safely.
- Use Compound Engineering after a review, fix, bug investigation, or repeated mistake: capture the lesson, root cause, fix, verification, and prevention rule so the next task is easier.
- Do not claim completion without fresh verification evidence. Do not perform risky deploy/send/delete/payment actions without approval gates.

## Assigned skills for this agent
- $(System.Collections.Specialized.OrderedDictionary.name): "You MUST use this before any creative work - creating features, building components, adding functionality, or modifying behavior. Explores user intent, requirements and design before implementation." [_company/_shared/vendor/obra-superpowers/skills/brainstorming/SKILL.md]
- $(System.Collections.Specialized.OrderedDictionary.name): "Generate and critically evaluate grounded ideas about a topic. Use when asking what to improve, requesting idea generation, exploring surprising directions, or wanting the AI to proactively suggest strong options before brainstorming one in depth. Triggers on phrases like 'what should I improve', 'give me ideas', 'ideate on X', 'surprise me', 'what would you change', or any request for AI-generated suggestions rather than refining the user's own idea." [_company/_shared/vendor/compound-engineering-plugin/plugins/compound-engineering/skills/ce-ideate/SKILL.md]
- $(System.Collections.Specialized.OrderedDictionary.name): 'Explore requirements and approaches through collaborative dialogue, then write a right-sized requirements document. Use when the user says "let''s brainstorm", "what should we build", or "help me think through X", presents a vague or ambitious feature request, or seems unsure about scope or direction -- even without explicitly asking to brainstorm.' [_company/_shared/vendor/compound-engineering-plugin/plugins/compound-engineering/skills/ce-brainstorm/SKILL.md]
- $(System.Collections.Specialized.OrderedDictionary.name): "Capture a visual demo reel (GIF, terminal recording, screenshots) for PR descriptions. Use when shipping UI changes, CLI features, or any work with observable behavior that benefits from visual proof. Also use when asked to add a demo, record a GIF, screenshot a feature, show what changed visually, create a demo reel, capture evidence, add proof to a PR, or create a before/after comparison." [_company/_shared/vendor/compound-engineering-plugin/plugins/compound-engineering/skills/ce-demo-reel/SKILL.md]
- $(System.Collections.Specialized.OrderedDictionary.name): Document a recently solved problem to compound your team's knowledge [_company/_shared/vendor/compound-engineering-plugin/plugins/compound-engineering/skills/ce-compound/SKILL.md]

## Required closeout habit
- At the end of any implementation/review cycle, ask: what mistake, surprise, repeated friction, or useful pattern should be compounded?
- If there is a reusable lesson, write/update a concise learning note under `_company/_shared/compound_lessons/` or mention it in the final report for CEO/Secretary to store.
